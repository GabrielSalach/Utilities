# RBPS (Really Bad Port Scanner)

This is a shitty port scanner done in Python in like 10 minutes thanks to a tutorial by [The CyberMentor](https://github.com/hmaverickadams). Also here's the [link for the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kq1MIfTWCE&t=11405s).

It still needs a lot of improvements to be useful (multithreading) but I'll implement this later, too lazy to learn this rn.
